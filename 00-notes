== for the future:

- search is just a filter for the current dir atm ->
  - search: recurse from current dir
  - search: recurse from MusicDir
  - maybe:
    - find ls(1) equiv in src -> read_directory()
    - a) make that recursive  -> already exists
    - b) make that optionally rooted from MusicDir
    - and filtering will 'just work'?
    - there already is a read_directory_recurr() used with playlists
    - implement a) and b) as 'special playlists'?

- delete function with confirmation prompt
  - can't get it to work with confirmation prompt because that prompt seems to be asynchronous
  - workaround to bind "rm -i" to F4
  - might use whatever exec_command uses to do it to bind it to d key if not on playlist
